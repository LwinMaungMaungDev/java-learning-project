    <p>My Java applet says:</p>
    <object data="HelloWorldApplet.class" width="150" height="25"></object>

<!-- 
    1) You refer to an applet in your HTML files with the <APPLET> tag.
    2) Use the CODE attribute to indicate the name of the class that contains your applet.
    3) Use the WIDTH and HEIGHT attributes to indicate the size of the applet. The browser uses
    these values to know how big a chunk of space to leave for the applet on the page.
    Here, a box 150 pixels wide and 25 pixels high is created.
