# Statements and Expressions

Statements sometimes return values—for example, when you add two numbers together or test
to see whether one value is equal to another. These kind of statements are called expressions.

# Variables and Data Types

Java actually has three kinds of variables: instance variables, class variables, and local variables.

Instance variables, as you learned yesterday, are used to define attributes or the state for a
particular object. Class variables are similar to instance variables, except their values apply to all
that class’s instances (and to the class itself) rather than having different values for each object.
Local variables are declared and used inside method definitions, for example, for index counters
in loops, as temporary variables, or to hold values that you need only inside the method
definition itself.

Unlike other languages, Java does not have global variables — that is, variables that are global to all parts of a program. Instance and class variables can be
used to communicate global information between and among objects. Remember,
Java is an object-oriented language, so you should think in terms of objects and
how they interact, rather than in terms of programs.
