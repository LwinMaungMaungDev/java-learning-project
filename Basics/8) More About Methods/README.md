# Overloading Methods

When you call a method in an object, Java matches up the method name and the number and type of arguments to choose which method definition to execute. To create an overloaded method, all you need to do is create several different method definitions in your class, all with the same name, but with different parameter lists (either in number or type of arguments) and with different bodies.

Note that Java differentiates overloaded methods with the same name, based on the number and type of parameters to that method, not on its return type. The variable names you choose for each parameter to the method are irrelevantâ€”all that matters is the number and the type.
