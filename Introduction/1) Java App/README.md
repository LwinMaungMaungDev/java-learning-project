# Java File Naming Convention

Conventionally, Java source files are named
the same name as the class they define, with an extension of .java. This file should therefore be
called HelloWorld.java.

# Compile the application

To compile your Java program, Make sure the javac program is in your execution path and type
javac followed by the name of your source file:

- javac HelloWorld.java

# Java Interpreter

When the program compiles without errors, you end up with a file called HelloWorld.class, in
the same directory as your source file. This is your Java bytecode file. You can then run that
bytecode file using the Java interpreter

- java HelloWorld
