/*
    1) All the program is enclosed in a class definitionâ€”here, a class called HelloWorld.

    2) The body of the program (here, just the one line) is contained in a routine called
    main(). In Java applications, as in a C or C++ program, main() is the first
    routine that is run when the program is executed.
