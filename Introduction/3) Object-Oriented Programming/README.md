# Objects and Classes

A class is a template for multiple objects with similar features. Classes embody all the
features of a particular set of objects. When you write a program in an object-oriented language, you donâ€™t define actual objects. You
define classes of objects.

An instance of a class is another word for an actual object. If classes are an abstract
representation of an object, an instance is its concrete representation.

In fact, the terms instance and object are often used interchangeably in OOP language. An
instance of a tree and a tree object are both the same thing.
